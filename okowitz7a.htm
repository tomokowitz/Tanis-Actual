Add the following to your project:
Make an XML file that contains at least 5 children of the root. Each child node is a some sort of user of your database. Each user node has at least 4 child nodes. One of the child nodes is a unique ID. The name of this file should be your lastname.xml (for me, it would be avitabile.xml).
Have an HTML file uses JavaScript to display the XML data in a table. 
Have an HTML file that lets you enter data into a text field, click a button to search for a user, and uses JavaScript to display their data.
When you are finished, your email should include the links to the page where the JavaScript is located.

Your new files should be named <lastname>7a.htm, and so on. For me, it would be avitabile7a.htm and so on.
There should be links to your new pages from your original start page.
